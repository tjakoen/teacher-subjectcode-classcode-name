# Authoring activities

How to add a new graded activity to a course. This is the canonical reference
for every stack (JS/Vitest, Dart, HTML/CSS/JS, quizzes). **m1a1 ("hello world")
is the standard template activity** every class copies from - it is the smallest
complete activity, and it exists live and public in all three example classes so
you can see one end to end (and watch its autograder run):

- JS/Vitest: [`HAU-6APSI/m1a1-classcode-yourname`](https://github.com/HAU-6APSI/m1a1-classcode-yourname)
- Dart: [`HAU-6ADET/m1a1-classcode-yourname`](https://github.com/HAU-6ADET/m1a1-classcode-yourname)
- HTML/CSS/JS: [`HAU-6INTROWEB/m1a1-classcode-yourname`](https://github.com/HAU-6INTROWEB/m1a1-classcode-yourname)

Every activity in those orgs is itself a template repo, so a teacher can copy
any of them directly.

> **Shared file.** This guide is byte-identical across the template and all live
> teacher repos. Edit it once, copy to all, commit each (see `CLAUDE.md` -> "When
> you change things"). The per-class differences are data (`assignments.json`,
> `grader/class-prompt.md`), never this doc.

## The mental model

An activity is four things, only the first two of which are required:

1. **A registry entry** in [`grader/assignments.json`](grader/assignments.json) -
   declares the activity exists, its type, and its flags.
2. **Canonical tests** under `grader/<id>/` - the source of truth for the score.
   The sweep overlays these onto each student clone before running, so a student
   editing their own copy of the tests changes nothing.
3. **A student scaffold** (the activity template repo) - the starter files a
   student works in: a stub to fill in, `student.json`, `README.md`, the dev
   container, and a student-facing copy of the tests.
4. **A rubric** `grader/<id>/RUBRIC.md` - **only for activities that cannot be
   judged by tests alone** (design, front-end craft, code quality). This is what
   turns an activity into an AI-enhanced one. Plain test-only activities do not
   get a rubric. See "Make it AI-enhanced" below.

Remember the platform's hard split: **grading never touches student repos.**
`grade-sweep.mjs` scores into the gradebook; `publish-grades.mjs` is the only
thing that delivers to students, and only when an activity is flagged
`"publish": true`. Authoring an activity is steps 1-4; delivery is a separate
switch you flip later.

## The spine: from simplest to richest

Every activity sits somewhere on this line. Build up only as far as you need.

```
test-only  ->  + Canvas points  ->  + AI feedback (RUBRIC)  ->  publish
  m1a1            totalPoints         ai-grading + feedback     publish:true
(hello world)                         + grader/<id>/RUBRIC.md
```

- **Test-only** (m1a1 and most m1/m2 activities): objective, pass/fail
  against canonical tests. No rubric, no AI. This is the default and most
  activities never leave here.
- **+ Canvas points:** add `"totalPoints"` so the score reconciles against
  Canvas (mismatches land in `gradebook/points-mismatch.md`).
- **+ AI feedback:** add `"ai-grading": true` + `"feedback"` + a
  `grader/<id>/RUBRIC.md`. Use this when the interesting part of the work is not
  test-checkable (visual design, responsiveness, code craft).
- **+ publish:** set `"publish": true` and run `publish.yml` to deliver.

## Anatomy of an activity (files)

```
teacher repo/
  grader/
    assignments.json          <- add your entry here
    class-prompt.md           <- class context for AI feedback (edit once per class)
    RUBRIC-TEMPLATE.md         <- copy this to make a RUBRIC.md
    <id>/                      <- canonical tests (overlaid onto each clone)
      ...test files...
      RUBRIC.md               <- ONLY if AI-graded
  content/
    <module>/
      <id>-<short-name>.md    <- the human-readable activity brief (optional but recommended)

activity template repo (what students copy):
  <stub the student edits>
  <student-facing copy of the tests>
  student.json                 <- the 6 identity fields, blank
  README.md                    <- the brief + how to submit
  .devcontainer/               <- Codespaces config
```

## `assignments.json` field reference

Each entry is one object in the array. Only `id`, `type`, `namePrefix` are
required.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | Unique activity id; also the receipt filename (e.g. `m1a1`). |
| `type` | yes | `vitest` (Node tests), `dart` (`dart test`), or `quiz` (match answers to a key). |
| `namePrefix` | yes | Student repos for this activity start with this (`m1a1-` matches `m1a1-<classcode>-<handle>`). |
| `key` | quiz only | Path to the answer key, e.g. `grader/q1/key.json`. |
| `totalPoints` | no | Canvas point value; reconciled vs Canvas -> `gradebook/points-mismatch.md`. |
| `ai-grading` | no | `true` turns on AI feedback for this activity (requires a `RUBRIC.md`). |
| `feedback` | no | `"project"` (design/front-end, uses screenshots) or `"code"` (code quality, no screenshots). |
| `previews` | no | `"branch"` reuses the project CI's published screenshots instead of rendering fresh. |
| `publish` | no | `true` delivers `GRADES.md`/`FEEDBACK.md` to students (default false). |
| `locked` | no | Prevents overwriting an already-synced Canvas grade. |
| `autoPoints` / `manual` | no | Legacy grade-split flags; avoid in new activities. |

## Step 1 - author a test-only activity

Using the live **m1a1 "hello world"** repos linked at the top as the model (copy
the one for your stack). The example below adds a hypothetical new activity
`m2a4`.

1. **Add the registry entry** to `grader/assignments.json`:
   ```jsonc
   { "id": "m2a4", "type": "vitest", "namePrefix": "m2a4-" }
   ```

2. **Write the canonical tests** under `grader/m2a4/`, mirroring the student
   repo layout so the overlay lands correctly. Every activity's tests should
   include the standard **`student.json` check** (the six identity fields), which
   is worth 1 point and appears in every activity across all classes.

3. **Build the student scaffold** in the activity template repo: a stub for the
   student to complete, a student-facing copy of the tests, a blank
   `student.json`, a `README.md` (the brief + how to submit + Codespaces note),
   and the `.devcontainer/`.

4. **Write the brief** (recommended) in
   `content/<module>/<id>-<short-name>.md`: the goal, "what to build", the
   **required contract** (the exact markers/structure the tests look for), and a
   minimal shape example - never the solution. Activity stubs name the concept to
   research; they never hand over the answer.

5. **Grade it locally** to confirm:
   ```bash
   node tools/grade-sweep.mjs <classcode> --only=m2a4
   ```

That is a complete activity. Stop here unless it needs points, AI feedback, or
delivery.

## Step 2 - add Canvas points

Add `"totalPoints": <n>` to the entry. The sweep reconciles this against Canvas
and reports any mismatch in `gradebook/points-mismatch.md`.

## Step 3 - make it AI-enhanced (add a RUBRIC)

Do this **only when the work cannot be fully judged by tests** - visual design,
responsive/layout craft, accessibility, or code quality. The tests still score
the objective half; the AI scores the subjective half and drafts feedback,
grounded in the rubric and `grader/class-prompt.md`.

1. Flag the entry:
   ```jsonc
   { "id": "m3a1", "type": "vitest", "namePrefix": "m3a1-",
     "totalPoints": 100, "ai-grading": true, "feedback": "project",
     "previews": "branch" }
   ```
   - `feedback: "project"` - design/front-end; uses screenshots.
   - `feedback: "code"` - code quality; no screenshots.

2. **Create `grader/<id>/RUBRIC.md`** from
   [`grader/RUBRIC-TEMPLATE.md`](grader/RUBRIC-TEMPLATE.md). The rubric has two
   halves - an automated half (scored by the tests) and a subjective half
   (scored by the AI) - and the total **must** equal `totalPoints` and Canvas.

3. **Distribute the rubric to all three places** (this is the rule that keeps AI
   grading grounded everywhere):
   - the teacher-canonical `grader/<id>/RUBRIC.md`,
   - the activity template repo,
   - every existing student submission repo (via `gh api` contents, committed as
     `course-bot`).

The student-facing feedback is prose only - **no scores, no mention of AI.** The
proposed grade and the AI-authored likelihood/"vibecode" flag stay
instructor-only in `gradebook/notes/`. Feedback is held for review until you
publish.

## Step 4 - deliver

Set `"publish": true` and run `publish.yml` (dry-run by default; `publish=true`
to actually push). Nothing reaches students until you do this.

## Stack specifics

The engine is identical; only the test layout and runner differ.

| Stack (class) | `type` | Tests live at | Runner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JS / React (6APSI) | `vitest` | `grader/<id>/hello.test.js` or `grader/<id>/test/*.test.jsx` | Vitest + `@testing-library/react` | Design activities use `previews: "branch"`. |
| HTML/CSS/JS (6INTROWEB) | `vitest` | `grader/<id>/test/*.test.js` | Vitest + `jsdom` (parses `src/index.html`) | Grades DOM structure. **Previews rendered locally by its `grade-sweep.mjs`**, not from a branch. |
| Dart / Flutter (6ADET) | `dart` | `grader/<id>/test/<name>_test.dart` | `dart pub get` + `dart test --reporter json` | Student code in `bin/`+`lib/`; needs the Dart SDK (CI uses `setup-dart`). |
| Quiz (any) | `quiz` | `grader/<id>/key.json` | Answer match (case-insensitive, trimmed) | Student answers in `quizzes/<id>/answers.json`. |

Two grading paths, one shape: JS and HTML both run under Vitest (HTML via jsdom
against `src/index.html`); Dart runs under `dart test`. In all three, the
canonical test is overlaid onto the clone so students cannot tamper with it, and
every activity carries the standard `student.json` check.

## The one-shot way (ask the assistant)

You do not have to do this by hand. Ask the assistant, e.g.:

> "Add a new test-only activity `m2a4` to 6INTROWEB: a page that includes a nav
> and a footer. Follow the existing m2 activities."

It will read the neighboring activities, follow the conventions above, and
produce the registry entry, canonical tests, scaffold, and brief. This guide is
what keeps that output consistent - and what to check its work against.

## Checklist

- [ ] Entry added to `grader/assignments.json` (`id`, `type`, `namePrefix`).
- [ ] Canonical tests under `grader/<id>/`, including the `student.json` check.
- [ ] Student scaffold: stub, student-facing tests, blank `student.json`,
      `README.md`, `.devcontainer/`.
- [ ] Brief in `content/<module>/` naming the concept, not the answer.
- [ ] If AI-enhanced: `totalPoints` + `ai-grading` + `feedback` set, and a
      `RUBRIC.md` whose total matches `totalPoints`, distributed to
      teacher-canonical + template + student repos.
- [ ] `node --check` any changed `.mjs`; `grade-sweep --only=<id>` runs clean.
- [ ] To deliver: `publish: true`, then `publish.yml`.
